**Important To Note**
- Ensure you have JDK 8 installed and Maven
- Make sure that MAVEN_HOME, JAVA_HOME, and PATH system variables are properly defined
	-For MAVEN_HOME, point it to the root Maven folder that directly houses the 'bin' folder.
	-For JAVA_HOME, point it to the root jdk 8 folder.
	-In the Path, add %MAVEN_HOME%\bin and %JAVA_HOME%\bin

- If there are problems with step 3 and the error shows "Error starting server", edit the
"application.yml" and "RadarTCPServerProperties.java" files, to change the Port Number to one that is unused.
